# Code Name Jeeves 
Zipfian FInal Project

Project idea is to get my computer to do something smart

First Thoughts - To Do:
- Find library to pull down gmail existing content
- Rework structure to align to loading on Heroku (leverage what I know)
- Setup environment load of APIs
- Figure out where to store (Postgres?, Mongo?)
- ID gmails that would classify true and group into training data
- Build classification model (review and leverage work from nlp project)


Nice to haves - will work on as time permits or when need a break:

- Setup Gmail API to receive 
- Draft Twilio code to push output to phone


Config Issues:
- ipython notebook defaults to Anaconda despite virtualenv
- found way to setup virtualenv and poin to System python instance but tbd to determine how to make it work with science packages needed
