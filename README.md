# Code Name Jeeves 
Zipfian FInal Project

Project idea is to get my computer to do something smart

First Thoughts - To Do:
- Figure out how to get data in and out of Postgres
- ID gmails that would classify true and group into training data
- Store training and test dataset in postgres 
- Pull out data to develop features


By Wed:
- Build classification model (review and leverage work from nlp project)


Nice to haves - will work on as time permits or when need a break:

- Setup Gmail API to receive mail
- Setup code for my computer to "say" the classification outcome whent its true

Config Issues:
- Resolved Anaconda, virtualenv and ipython issues
- still tbd if science packages issues with virtualenv
